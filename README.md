# Crypto Toolbox
An open-source toolbox for daily cryptography needs which is developed in Python using Streamlit platform.

## Apps
### JWT - JSON Web Token
Encoding/Decoding JWT tokens using different encryption algorithms and parameters.

### RSA Key Generator
Generating RSA Private and Public Keys.

### RSA Data Encryptor/Decryptor
Encrypting data using public key and decrypting using private key.

### RSA Digital Signature
Signing files using RSA private key.

### RSA Signature Validator
Validating the digital signature using RSA public key. The digital signature has been generated using private key.

### Fernet
Encrypting/Decrypting files using Fernet.

### Base64
Encoding/Decoding files/text using Base64.

## Run
In order to run this app, you need to install the dependencies first based on
the `_environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` files. Once the dependencies are installed, run the dashboard using
`streamlit`.

    streamlit run ./main.py

### Run on Docker
This application is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kavehbc/crypto-tools), and it can be run directly using:

    docker run -p 80:8501 kavehbc/crypto-tools

Once you run it, you can open it in your browser on [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1).

> **Apple M1 Silicon - Arm64**
> 
> As of today (`Dec 2021`), this Docker Image is not compatible with `Apple M1 Silicon`.
> Instead, the source code can be run using `conda` on `Rosetta 2`.
